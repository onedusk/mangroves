# Sprint 02: Tenant Isolation Tests

## Status: INCOMPLETE

## Implementation Summary:
Tenant isolation tests were implemented across multiple spec files including tenant_scoped_spec.rb, shared examples, workspace_spec.rb, workspace_membership_spec.rb, and team_membership_spec.rb. Tests cover cross-tenant isolation, auto-assignment, and unscoped_all functionality. However, two critical tests fail due to implementation issues.

## Subtasks Completed: 6/8

## Issues Found:

**CRITICAL:**
- Test "auto-assigns Current.account on create" fails because TenantScoped's before_validation hook uses `||=` operator, which assigns account before the test expectation runs (account is already set before save!)
- Test "raises an error when Current.account is missing" fails with NoMethodError in Workspace#generate_slug (line 69) when trying to call account.workspaces without nil check

**MEDIUM:**
- WorkspaceMembership and TeamMembership validation tests pass (2/2 each)
- Cross-tenant isolation tests pass (3/5 in tenant_scoped_spec.rb, 3/5 in workspace_spec.rb)

## Recommendation: NEEDS_WORK

**Required fixes:**
1. Adjust test expectation for auto-assignment test or refactor TenantScoped hook timing
2. Add nil guard in Workspace#generate_slug before accessing account.workspaces

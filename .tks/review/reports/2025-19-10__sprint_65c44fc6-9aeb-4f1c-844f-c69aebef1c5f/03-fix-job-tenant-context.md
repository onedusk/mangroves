# Sprint 03: Fix Job Tenant Context

## Status: COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary:
ApplicationJob implements tenant context preservation using an around_perform callback that extracts account_id from job arguments, sets Current.account using Current.set block for automatic cleanup, and handles both keyword and hash argument formats. Documentation comment provides clear guidance for future job creation.

## Subtasks Completed: 8/8

1. around_perform callback extracts account_id from job arguments
2. Current.account assignment via Current.set with automatic cleanup
3. around_perform block ensures cleanup via Current.set block syntax
4. spec/jobs/application_job_spec.rb created with comprehensive tests
5. Test verifies Current.account restoration (8 test cases)
6. Test verifies Current.account cleanup after completion and failures
7. Documentation comment explains pattern with usage example
8. All tests pass (8 examples, 0 failures)

## Issues Found:
None. Implementation follows Rails conventions, uses Current.set for automatic cleanup, handles edge cases (missing account, errors, multiple accounts), and includes thorough test coverage.

## Recommendation: MOVE_TO_DONE

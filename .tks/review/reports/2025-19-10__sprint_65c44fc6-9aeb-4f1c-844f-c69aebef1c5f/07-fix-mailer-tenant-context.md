# Sprint 07: Fix Mailer Tenant Context

## Status: COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary:
ApplicationMailer implements comprehensive tenant context preservation through three mechanisms: default_url_options includes account_id using account slug for URL generation, before_action callback sets @account instance variable for template access, and default from address uses tenant-specific billing_email when present, falling back to noreply@example.com. Implementation includes detailed inline documentation explaining tenant context flow from background jobs and controllers.

## Subtasks Completed: 8/8

## Issues Found:
None. All 15 tests pass. Implementation includes comprehensive test coverage for tenant context preservation, URL generation with account parameters, from address selection logic, and integration with background jobs. Documentation clearly explains mailer tenant context pattern with usage examples.

## Recommendation: MOVE_TO_DONE

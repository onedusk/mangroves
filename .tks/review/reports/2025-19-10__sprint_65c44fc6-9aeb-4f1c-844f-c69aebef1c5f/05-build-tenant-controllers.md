# Sprint 05: Build Tenant Controllers

## Status: COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary:
AccountsController and WorkspacesController fully implemented with CRUD operations, Pundit authorization, and nested routes. Both controllers enforce tenant isolation through authentication guards (require_account!, authorize_account_access!) and Pundit policies. Comprehensive request specs verify authorization, cross-tenant isolation, and role-based access control.

## Subtasks Completed: 8/8

1. AccountsController generated with Pundit authorize calls
2. WorkspacesController generated with set_account from params[:account_id]
3. Authentication guards implemented (require_account!, authorize_account_access!)
4. Nested routes configured (accounts > workspaces)
5. devise_for :members removed, member.rb does not exist
6. spec/requests/accounts_spec.rb created with full authorization tests
7. Request specs test unauthorized access with redirects and 403 status
8. Cross-tenant specs verify Account A users cannot access Account B data (404/403)

## Issues Found:
None. All 29 request specs pass. Pundit policies enforce role hierarchy (viewer < member < admin < owner). Cross-tenant isolation verified.

## Recommendation: MOVE_TO_DONE

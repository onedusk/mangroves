⏺ Code Review: Tenant Scoping Sprint

  Executive Summary

  The tenant scoping implementation is well-executed with strong patterns and comprehensive testing. The sprint
  successfully applied the TenantScoped concern to core models and established guardrails for future
  development.

  Sprint Completion: 7/8 subtasks completed (missing: git commit with specified message)

  1. Implementation Quality Review

  TenantScoped Concern (app/models/concerns/tenant_scoped.rb:1)

  Strengths:
  - Clean, focused implementation using ActiveSupport::Concern
  - Properly uses belongs_to :account with automatic validation
  - default_scope appropriately guards against nil Current.account
  - Provides escape hatch via unscoped_all class method
  - Auto-assignment pattern is idempotent (uses ||=)

  Observation:
  The use of default_scope is generally discouraged in Rails conventions, but here it's acceptable because:
  1. The guard condition prevents application when Current.account is nil
  2. The domain model explicitly requires tenant isolation
  3. The unscoped_all escape hatch is provided for administrative operations

  Note: Line 9 uses default_scope which is mentioned in rails_conventions.md:224 as something to avoid, but this
   is a deliberate architectural choice for multi-tenancy.

  Workspace Model (app/models/workspace.rb:30)

  Strengths:
  - include TenantScoped correctly placed after class declaration
  - Inline comment clearly explains purpose: "Auto-assigns and scopes records to Current.account"
  - belongs_to :account is present (line 35)
  - Slug generation properly scopes to account (line 69)

  Observations:
  - PaperTrail integration correctly includes account_id in metadata (line 33)
  - Composite unique index on [:account_id, :slug] prevents cross-tenant collisions

  Team Model (app/models/team.rb:33)

  Strengths:
  - include TenantScoped with descriptive comment: "Enforces default scope + auto-assigns tenant on create"
  - Correctly syncs account_id from workspace via callback (line 86-88)
  - Validates account/workspace alignment (line 90-95)
  - PaperTrail tracks both account_id and workspace_id (line 36)

  Excellent pattern:
  before_validation :sync_account_from_workspace
  validate :account_matches_workspace
  This dual approach ensures data integrity even if TenantScoped is bypassed.

  AccountMembership Model (app/models/account_membership.rb:34)

  Bonus implementation (not in sprint scope):
  - Correctly includes TenantScoped
  - Makes semantic sense: memberships should be scoped to current account
  - Comment: "Restrict membership queries to Current.account"

  ---
  2. Test Coverage Analysis

  Guard Spec (spec/tools/tenant_scoping_guard_spec.rb:1)

  Excellent implementation:
  - Uses eager loading to inspect all models (line 7)
  - Properly filters for models with account_id column (line 15)
  - Exempts Account model (correct - it IS the tenant)
  - Clear failure message identifies offending models (line 24)
  - Will catch future models that violate the convention

  Recommendation:
  Consider adding WorkspaceMembership and TeamMembership to exemptions list with documentation explaining
  they're scoped through parent associations rather than direct account_id.

  Shared Examples (spec/support/shared_examples/tenant_scoped.rb:1)

  Comprehensive test coverage:
  1. Query scoping verification (lines 19-29)
  2. Auto-assignment behavior (lines 31-36)
  3. Validation failure when Current.account missing (lines 38-42)
  4. Bypass mechanism with unscoped_all (lines 44-55)

  Strengths:
  - Uses around block to reset Current state (lines 6-10)
  - Abstract interface via build_tenant_record_for method
  - Tests both positive and negative cases

  Model Specs

  Workspace (spec/models/workspace_spec.rb:32):
  - Explicitly tests TenantScoped inclusion (line 33-35)
  - Uses shared examples (line 37-41)
  - Custom factory method provided (lines 38-40)

  Team (spec/models/team_spec.rb:35):
  - Tests TenantScoped inclusion (line 42-44)
  - Uses shared examples (line 46-51)
  - Includes team-specific validation test for account/workspace alignment (lines 54-64)
  - Properly creates workspace fixture in factory method (line 48)

  AccountMembership (spec/models/account_membership_spec.rb:35):
  Issue: Only contains pending test - should include TenantScoped shared examples

  ---
  3. Documentation Review

  Rails Conventions (docs/rails_conventions.md:20)

  Well documented:
  "Multi-tenant tables with an account_id column must include
  TenantScoped—spec/tools/tenant_scoping_guard_spec.rb enforces this."

  Comprehensive multi-tenant section (lines 116-245):
  - Covers tenancy models, request resolution, data modeling, enforcement
  - Documents jobs, caching, billing considerations
  - Includes safe defaults checklist
  - References both default_scope concerns AND RLS as alternatives

  Note: The conventions document mentions avoiding default_scope (line 224) but also acknowledges TenantScoped's
   use of it, which is appropriate given the explicit architectural choice.

  4. Additional Findings

  Models with account_id (from schema analysis):

  1. account_memberships - ✓ Has TenantScoped
  2. teams - ✓ Has TenantScoped
  3. workspaces - ✓ Has TenantScoped
  4. audit_events - account_id is nullable, intentionally global
  5. versions (PaperTrail) - account_id is nullable, audit metadata only

  Reasoning for audit_events:
  The nullable account_id on AuditEvent (line 15) is appropriate because:
  - Audit events can be system-wide (user login/logout)
  - Has explicit for_account scope for filtering (line 44)
  - Auto-captures Current.account when available (line 62)

  Models WITHOUT account_id (correctly designed):

  1. WorkspaceMembership - Scoped via workspace relationship
  2. TeamMembership - Scoped via team relationship
  3. User - Global resource with many-to-many tenant relationships

  Note: These models use delegate pattern:
  delegate :account, to: :workspace  # WorkspaceMembership:49
  delegate :workspace, :account, to: :team  # TeamMembership:49

  ---
  5. Issues Found

  CRITICAL: None

  HIGH: None

  MEDIUM:

  1. Missing git commit - Sprint subtask #8 requires commit with message "Add TenantScoped concern to Workspace
  and Team models" - not found in git history

  LOW:

  1. AccountMembership spec incomplete - Has TenantScoped but spec only contains pending test
  (spec/models/account_membership_spec.rb:36)
  2. Guard spec exemptions - Could document why certain models with account_id relationships don't need
  TenantScoped

  INFORMATIONAL:

  1. default_scope usage - While documented in conventions as generally avoided, the use here is intentional and
   appropriate for multi-tenancy
  2. AuditEvent scoping - Has nullable account_id but uses explicit scopes instead of TenantScoped (correct
  design choice)

  ---
  6. Security Analysis

  Tenant Isolation: STRONG

  - Default scope prevents accidental cross-tenant queries
  - Auto-assignment ensures records always have account_id
  - Guard spec prevents future models from bypassing pattern
  - Composite unique indexes enforce tenant-scoped uniqueness

  Potential Risks (mitigated):

  1. default_scope bypass - Developers could use unscoped and accidentally leak data
    - Mitigation: Documented as unscoped_all for explicit intent
  2. Current.account not set - Could cause validation failures
    - Mitigation: Validation error prevents silent failures
  3. Cross-tenant associations - Team could reference workspace from different account
    - Mitigation: Team model has explicit validation (line 90-95)

  8. Recommendations

  Immediate Actions:

  1. Create git commit with message: "Add TenantScoped concern to Workspace and Team models"
  2. Update AccountMembership spec to include tenant scoped shared examples

  Short-term Improvements:

  1. Enhance guard spec with exemptions list and documentation:
  exemptions = [
    Account,  # IS the tenant
    AuditEvent,  # Global audit trail with explicit scopes
    WorkspaceMembership,  # Scoped via workspace delegation
    TeamMembership  # Scoped via team delegation
  ]
  2. Add documentation explaining delegation pattern for membership models

  Long-term Considerations:

  1. Consider PostgreSQL RLS as mentioned in rails_conventions.md:175-190 for defense-in-depth
  2. Monitor for N+1 queries when loading tenant-scoped associations
  3. Add integration tests for common workflows to ensure Current.account is properly set throughout request
  lifecycle

  Conclusion

  This sprint delivered a robust, well-tested multi-tenant scoping system. The use of the TenantScoped concern
  provides a consistent pattern that's enforced by automated tests. The implementation demonstrates strong
  understanding of Rails patterns and multi-tenant architecture.

  Key Strengths:
  - Defensive programming with validations
  - Comprehensive test coverage via shared examples
  - Automated enforcement via guard spec
  - Clear documentation of conventions

  Minor Gaps:
  - Missing git commit (process issue)
  - One pending test file

  The codebase is production-ready from a tenant isolation perspective. The guard spec will prevent future
  regressions, making this a sustainable pattern for the application.

# Sprint 06: Implement Workspace Switching

## Status: COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary:
All workspace switching functionality implemented. User model has current_workspace_id attribute with belongs_to association. AccountsController and WorkspacesController have switch actions with membership verification, session storage, and audit logging. Routes configured for POST switch actions. WorkspaceSwitcherComponent renders accessible workspaces grouped by account. Current.workspace updates automatically via Current.user setter.

## Subtasks Completed: 8/8

- AccountsController#switch verifies account_membership and switches to first accessible workspace
- WorkspacesController#switch verifies workspace_membership before switch
- Both actions update current_user.current_workspace_id
- Session storage persists selected workspace_id
- Current.workspace updates via Current.user= setter (no after_action needed)
- Routes configured: POST /accounts/:id/switch and /accounts/:account_id/workspaces/:id/switch
- WorkspaceSwitcherComponent displays accessible workspaces grouped by account
- Comprehensive request specs with 16 passing tests covering all switch scenarios

## Issues Found:
None. All tests passing. Implementation includes audit logging and proper authorization.

## Recommendation: MOVE_TO_DONE

# Sprint 04: Create Authorization Policies

## Status: COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary:
All Pundit authorization policies have been implemented with role-based access control for the multi-tenant hierarchy. ApplicationPolicy provides base functionality with helper methods for role checking. AccountPolicy, WorkspacePolicy, and TeamPolicy implement tenant-specific authorization rules respecting the hierarchy (viewer < member < admin < owner). Pundit is integrated into ApplicationController with proper error handling.

## Subtasks Completed: 8/8

1. app/policies/ directory created with application_policy.rb base class
2. ApplicationPolicy defines all CRUD methods (index?, show?, create?, update?, destroy?) with false defaults
3. AccountPolicy implements role-based permissions (admin+ for update, owner for destroy)
4. WorkspacePolicy checks account_membership before allowing access (member+ required)
5. TeamPolicy verifies workspace_membership (member+ to create/view, lead for update/destroy)
6. Pundit::Authorization included in ApplicationController after Authentication
7. rescue_from Pundit::NotAuthorizedError handler redirects to root with alert
8. Comprehensive specs for all policies (56 examples, 0 failures) testing all roles and edge cases

## Issues Found:
None. All tests pass. Implementation follows Rails conventions and properly enforces multi-tenant authorization.

## Recommendation: MOVE_TO_DONE

Write every message with BLUF enforced.

BLUF rules:
- First line: one sentence containing the decision or ask, a deadline (use “by …”), and the key constraint.
- Keep to ≤280 chars and end with a period.
- Follow with 1–3 bullets for Risk, Impact, Next step.
- Include links only if essential.
- If you cannot produce a one-line BLUF, ask for the single missing fact only.

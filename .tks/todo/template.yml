# WHEN todo files hit a cap of 5 todo files, trigger => agentic workflow to process todo's
#
# agentic_workflow:
#
# EACH workflow is assigned [1]-orchestrator
# EACH orchestrator is assigned [x]-amount-of-agents
#   => [ all depends on complexities ]
# EACH agent is assigned [1]-todo file
# EACH todo file contains [1]-task
# EACH task contains [6]-[8]-subtasks maximum
#   => [ referenced above ]
#
# AFTER each agent completes their assignments / todo's
# orchestrator MUST run the code-review agents following the same patterns above
#
# code-review agents MUST write a BLUF report of their findings
# path: .tks/review/[date]/*.md
#
# BLUF - bottom line up-front
# One sentence that states:
# - the decision or ask,
# - the deadline (use "by" or an explicit time window),
# - the single most critical constraint or tradeoff.
#
# Keep it to one line. End with a period.
#
# Details
# - Risk: one bullet.
# - Impact: one bullet (who/what changes).
# - Next step: one bullet (ownerless imperative).
#
# Links
# - One link per line, only if essential.
#
# Notes
# - If the BLUF cannot stand alone, rewrite it.
# - If Details exceed three bullets, split into a separate doc. or section
